Positive values attract and negative values repel. The net force on the rigid body is calculated using f = constant + linear * r + inverseSquare / r^2, where r is the distance to the center. Forces can be attenuated based on their position relative to the cone central axis with the  linearFalloff and powerFalloff inputs.",
